  <br>
  I will give to you
  <br>
  My cunning, My hearing
  <br>
  My eyes which to see
  <br>
  That they may lead you
  <br>
  As they have led me.
  <br>
  I give to you my strength
  <br>
  In your heart my voice
  <br>
  Hear me, I will help you
  <br>
  Make the right choice.
  <br>
  So that you don't tire while you
  <br>
  Find much food for your people to eat
  <br>
  I give to you my stamina
  <br>
  My legs and my feet.
  <br>
  Should dangers linger in the air
  <br>
  Brave warrior you will always tell
  <br>
  For next I give to you
  <br>
  My keen sense of smell.
  <br>
  For your love of your people
  <br>
  And the land that we are a part
  <br>
  It is as abiding as mine
  <br>
  So I give to you my heart.
  <br>
  Brave warrior accept me
  <br>
  And all that I give
  <br>
  For forever together
  <br>
  You and I will live.
  <br>
  Awake now brave warrior
  <br>
  And look to the ground
  <br>
  For there will be proof
  <br>
  Of what you've just found.
