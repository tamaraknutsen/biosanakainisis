    Many of you will have ample time to explore the wonders of Zion.  Here are some suggested hikes!  Of course, you should also peruse the information on the official <a href="http://www.nps.gov/zion/planyourvisit/hiking-in-zion.htm" target="_blank">park website</a> or on <a href="http://www.utah.com/nationalparks/zion/hiking_trails.htm" target="_blank">utah.com</a> or <a href="http://www.canyoneeringusa.com/utah/zion/trails/" target="_blank">canyoneeringusa.com</a>.

        <div style="margin-top:10px;">
          <p><em>Difficulty: Medium to Hard.  Not for those with a fear of heights.</em></p>

            From <a href="http://www.canyoneeringusa.com/utah/zion/trails/angels-landing-zion-national-park/"
              target="_blank"> canyoneeringusa.com
            </a>: Angels Landing is one of the most exciting, intimidating, and famous trails in the National Park Service. In many places, steps were hewn out of the rock and thick chain installed along the knife-edge ridge to provide security for the non-mountaineer. Many find the final ridge too much, and wait at the "Widow's Tree" for their companions to return from the summit. Those who continue to the top will enjoy amazing views of Zion Canyon, from a lofty perch.

      <li class="list-group-item"><strong>Observation Point and Hidden Canyon</strong>
        <div style="margin-top:10px;">
          <p><em>Difficulty: Medium.  Significant elevation gain, but otherwise very straight-forward.</em></p>
          <p>
            Hidden Canyon and Observation Point can be done together, as they
            start from the same trail-head. Hidden Canyon is a lovely side
            canyon with a lot to explore on the way up and down to Observation
            Point.

            About Observation Point from <a href="http://www.canyoneeringusa.com/utah/zion/trails/observation-point-trail/"
                    target="_blank"> canyoneeringusa.com
            </a>: Observation Point offers a tremendous view from high on the east canyon rim. From here, Zion can be seen as a vast, dissected plateau. The view is not as intimate as from Angels Landing and the effort substantially more, so there tend to be many fewer people, making for a quieter experience.

            About Hidden Canyon from <a href="http://www.canyoneeringusa.com/utah/zion/trails/hidden-canyon-trail/"
                    target="_blank"> canyoneeringusa.com
            </a>: While hikes like Angels Landing or Observation Point satisfy the macho, goal-oriented hiker, Hidden Canyon is more of a sublime, spiritual experience. A nice place to while away a few hours on a hot summer day, the beautiful, well-shaded grotto offers no specific objective - and is better for it.

                    target="_blank"> canyoneeringusa.com
            </a>: Built in 1926, the Emerald Pools "Trail" is a collection of short, linking loop trails and spurs across the river from Zion Lodge. The trail visits a couple of wonderful waterfalls, three small pools, and the amazing cirque where Heaps Canyon and Behunin Canyon drop into Zion Canyon.

      <li class="list-group-item"><strong>The Narrows (bottom up)</strong>
        <div style="margin-top:10px;">
          <p><em>Difficulty: Medium. The hike is not too challenging, but some special preparation is required to stay warm.  You will get wet!</em></p>
          <p>
            One of the most famous hikes in Zion, and in the world, are the
            "Narrows" of Zion. This hike has no trail... you will be wading up
            the Virgin River, and exploring this big canyon system with wet
            feet. Being that this is late spring, you can expect the water to be
            relatively cold (in the 40's), so come prepared with warm socks
            (Neoprene!), good river shoes, and a walking stick or pole. People
            who attempt this hike may find the services of
            the <a href="http://www.zionadventures.com/">Zion Adventure
            Company</a> useful for purchasing or renting gear.
          </p>
          <p>
            Although this hike does require some preparation, it is a truly
            rewarding experience and highly recommended.

            target="_blank"> canyoneeringusa.com
            </a>: The walk UP the Zion Narrows from the Temple of Sinawava is a
            wonderful hike, perhaps the third-best "trail" in the Park. Even
            with a side-trip
            up <a href="http://www.canyoneeringusa.com/utah/zion/technical/orderville-canyon/"
            target="_blank">Orderville Canyon</a> (highly recommended) the
            logistics are simple, and the trip can be a couple-of-hours thing, a
            half-day hike, or a full-day adventure. Accessible to anyone with
            solid walking abilities and a sense of adventure and fun, the
            Narrows has probably seen more visitors than any canyon on Earth.
            Canyoneering for everyone!

      <li class="list-group-item"><strong>Orderville Canyon</strong>
        <div style="margin-top:10px;">
          <p><em>Difficulty: Hard.  This is a technical canyon.  It does not require long rappeling descents, but a hand line is required in several places.  It is an excellent introduction to technical canyoneering, but is easy enough that no significant training is necessary to enter it.  However, do not attempt this hike unless you feel confident in your skills and you have done your own research!</em></p>
          <p>
            From <a href="http://www.canyoneeringusa.com/utah/zion/technical/orderville-canyon/"
                    target="_blank"> canyoneeringusa.com
            </a>: Orderville is a wonderfully fun canyon. With two short
            obstacles where ropes are often used, it is the easiest technical
            canyon in the Zion:Canyoneering book, or the hardest off-trail hike.
            Due to the clay soils in its headwaters, Orderville can be
            exceptionally slippery, so the experienced Ordervillean brings a
            short rope on all trips. Orderville changes from trip-to-trip more
            than most canyons, and the washing away of a log or filling of a
            pool could make that easy move last trip difficult and dangerous.
            Bring a rope to use as a handline, and the skills required for using
            it safely.
