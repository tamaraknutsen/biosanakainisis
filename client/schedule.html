    We will be staying with our immediate family at the Zion Villa from May
    6th-10th. The Villa will serve as the base of operations for a variety of
    fun adventures during the week and weekend of our wedding. We hope that some
    of you can come early and join us as we enjoy the wonders of Zion.

          We will be hanging out, visiting with friends who come by, and cooking
